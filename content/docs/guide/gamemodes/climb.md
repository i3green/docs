## What is Climb?

Climb, also known as Kreedz **Climb**ing (KZ) or Xtreme **Climb** (XC), is a popular gamemode found in every Counter-Strike game. The goal of Climb is to get from point A to point B in a map in the quickest time possible. It's series of platforming challenges that can be best simplified as "trick jumps" which pull from the big 3 movement disciplines in source, Strafing, Bhop, and Surf/Slide to challenge players in scaling its maps. players are not forced to consecutively string together jumps unlike bhop or surf. This is great for players who only care about completion or are learning the map. However, for speedrunning, stopping to get your bearings is inadvisable.

## History of Climb

Climb started in Counter-strike 1.1. A mapper named Kreedz decided to make a fun mess-around map that did not have the usual defuse objective for his friends. Kreedz enjoys climbing as a hobby, so he felt that there should be some trees you could climb. Kreedz found this aspect of the map to be particularly fun. He made more maps with a focus on this climbing aspect, and always named them with a kz_ tag as a sort of signature. Eventually they caught on and the kz_ tag stuck! It has become so popular that it has branched off into other games like **Half-Life** and even spawned its own game, [Kreedz Climbing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/626680/Kreedz_Climbing/). [Xtreme-Jumps](https://xtreme-jumps.eu/news.php) is currently the central hub for CS 1.6 Climb

## How Climb Works

### Strafing
Strafing is the most common focus for maps and what sets Climb apart from the Bhop and surf game modes. Strafing can come in the form of long jumps and taking indirect lines. 
Strafing works in the same way that bunny hopping does; pressing W or S combined with a strafe key causes the player to receive more velocity than simply holding W or S. Combining this with turning the player's camera in line with the strafe key, a player can get lots of momentum to jump to far platforms. This is normally called a **prestrafe**. This can be further improved by letting go of W in the air but continuing the mouse and strafe key pattern, called **airstrafing**. gaining speed before the jump and while in the air lets you travel futher. This is called a **long jump**. There are 2 other forms of longjump that are more advanced, [countjumps](https://kz-rush.com/en/page/countjump-physics) and [highjumps](https://kz-rush.com/page/highjump-physics). 

Sometimes you may not be able to take a direct line due to an obstruction. The 2 most common forms of this is rounding a corner (often without being able to see the next platform) and 2 platforms separated by a thin wall. 

In this case, air strafing is not used to gain speed but as a form of air control. The principle is the same but typically smooth turns at the cost of speed are needed (don't take out all your speed or you'll fall straight down!).

### Bhop
[Due to diffrent physics](https://kz-rush.ru/en/page/bhop-physics) and map design, bhops are mostly used as a way to preserve speed rather than to go fast but it is still very useful.  
Climb has a jump-landing penalty, the impact of which can be severely limited with bhops. This can be used as a general speedrunning technique by stringing jumps together that are close in distance and height. 
The map can also encourage a bhop by making a very small platform that, if stopped on, does not allow the player to get a running start before they jump to the next platform.

### Surf
Surf/Slide is also limited compared to its dedicated game mode. Air acceleration in Climb  (10aa?) is a lot less than surf's(150aa?)
This means players can't as easily flick onto a ramp ("board") and genearate speed, or flick off a ramp and generate height. surfs are usually brief and focus on keeping on the board (**"sliding"**) rather than gaining enough speed to fly off. However, the process of surfing is still the same as its game mode counterpart.
Climb surf has the additional quirk of allowing the user to slide up gentle slopes with just 'W' while looking at the slope

### Stamina (Jump-Land Penalty) [depends on if Climb uses 1.6 style movment]
Any time the player jumps (not when they are in the air for any other reason such as falling off something) a timer starts for about 1.31 seconds. 
Whenever the player lands, they will be slowed for however much time is left on the timer.
For reference, if a player jumps and lands on flat ground about 0.66 seconds or about half the time is taken.
This means that jumping up to something slows you down longer since you land earlier. And jumping to something beneath will slow you less or not at all.
For speedrunning getting around this stamnia is a top prority for optimzing runs. For completion players only certain types of platforms make stamina a cause for concern namely ones that are to small or awkward to get a running start from a standsill.
