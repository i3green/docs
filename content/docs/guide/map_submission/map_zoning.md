# Zoning Requirements

- TODO: More stuff!!
-
- If a zone region's location has a map teleport destination entity, we _highly_ prefer that it is used (rather than a custom arbitrary region destination coordinate) so the spot corresponds to a map teleport destination.

- Make sure each region teleport destination is inside the region.

- Avoid overlapping or touching regions for the same zone which could just be one region.

- Make sure points are placed precisely and aligned well with geometry.

- Fill stage/bonus teleport hub areas with a cancel zone for safety.

- Checkpoints should be placed where they can be hit consistently for better split comparisons. This means placing them in the middle of hallways rather than after a turn where the player can hit the checkpoint sooner or later depending on how much they cut the corner.
